# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Reduce the vertical spacing between the Stories row and the first post on the Home feed while keeping the existing Home layout intact.

**Planned changes:**
- Update the Home page layout spacing/margins so the first PostCard sits closer to the Stories row.
- Ensure spacing remains consistent across common breakpoints (mobile and lg desktop) without overlap.
- Preserve the lg desktop right-side “Suggested for you” panel column placement and alignment.

**User-visible outcome:** On the Home page, posts start closer to the Stories section with a noticeably smaller gap, while the rest of the layout remains unchanged.
